# Task 7: Browser Extension Review

#### By: Yug Dabgar (aka MASTERxD)

## Overview
As part of this task, I reviewed all extensions installed in my Brave browser to check for any suspicious or potentially harmful add-ons. The goal was to evaluate their permissions and remove anything unnecessary or risky.

## Browser Used
- Brave (Chromium-based)

## What I Did
1. Opened the extensions page (`brave://extensions/`)
2. Reviewed each installed extension manually
3. Checked what permissions they were using (like access to website data or incognito mode)
4. Googled any unknown names to verify their reputation
5. Found that all extensions were clean and necessary — no action required

## Screenshots
- `extension_list.png` – List of all installed extensions
- `extension_detail_example.png` – Example of a permission panel for one trusted extension

## Key Takeaways
- It’s important to review browser extensions regularly
- Extensions with access to "all website data" should be used carefully
- Unused or shady-looking extensions should be removed immediately
- Always download extensions only from the official Chrome Web Store or trusted sources

## Conclusion
While no risky extensions were found on my system, this task helped me understand how attackers may use malicious browser extensions to collect data, inject scripts, or compromise security.
